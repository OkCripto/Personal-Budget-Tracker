## User Guide

### 1. The Dashboard (Tracker)
The main screen provides a high-level overview of your current financial health.
* **Summary Cards:** View your total monthly Income, Expenses, Savings, and current Net Worth at a glance.
* **Privacy Mode:** Click the eye icon in the top header to hide or reveal specific monetary values. This is useful if you are using the tracker in a public setting.
* **Dark Mode:** Use the sun/moon toggle to switch between light and dark themes for better visibility.

### 2. Managing Transactions
To record financial activity, use the "Add Transaction" form on the Tracker page.
* **Type:** Select "Income" for money coming in (salary, sales) or "Expense" for money going out.
* **Account/Asset:** Choose which account the money is affecting (e.g., Cash, Bank Account).
* **Category:** Select a category (e.g., Food, Transport) to keep your spending organized. You can create custom categories using the "Manage Categories" button.
* **Date & Description:** Enter the date of the transaction and a brief description.
* **Notes:** Optionally add detailed notes for future reference.

### 3. Managing Assets and Accounts
Navigate to the "Assets" tab to manage your financial accounts.
* **Asset List:** View balances for different accounts, such as Cash, Checking, Savings, or Investments.
* **Add New Asset:** Use the "Manage" button to create new accounts (e.g., "Credit Card," "Emergency Fund") and set their starting balances.
* **Transfers:** Use the Transfer Funds form to move money between accounts (e.g., moving money from Bank to Cash). This adjusts account balances without affecting your total income or expense reports.

### 4. Analytics and Reports
The "Analytics" tab provides visual insights into your spending habits.
* **Filters:** View data for specific time periods (This Week, This Month, Year to Date).
* **Expense Breakdown:** A pie chart shows exactly where your money is going by category.
* **Spending Trend:** A line graph visualizes your spending patterns over time to help you identify high-spending days.

### 5. Data Management and Backup
Because this application works offline and stores data in your browser, it is important to back up your data if you switch devices or clear your browser cache.
* **Export Data:** Click "Data Options" to download your financial data as a JSON file (for backup) or a CSV file (for use in Excel or Google Sheets).
* **Import Data:** You can restore your data on a new device by importing your previously saved JSON file.
